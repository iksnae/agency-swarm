# Docs for `get_openai_client` and `set_openai_key` Functions

## Overview

The provided Python code includes two functions, `get_openai_client` and `set_openai_key`, which are designed to manage the OpenAI client's instantiation and configuration within a threaded environment. These functions ensure safe and efficient access to the OpenAI API.

## Function Definitions

### 1. `get_openai_client`

This function retrieves or initializes the OpenAI client.

- **Purpose**: To ensure thread-safe access and initialization of a single OpenAI client instance.

- **Behavior**:
  - Uses a global variable `client` to store the client instance.
  - Implements thread locking to prevent race conditions during client instantiation.
  - Checks for the OpenAI API key either in the `openai.api_key` or environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
  - Uses `instructor.patch` to patch the OpenAI client for additional functionality.

- **Error Handling**: Raises a `ValueError` if the OpenAI API key is not set.

- **Returns**: An instance of the OpenAI client.

### 2. `set_openai_key`

This function sets the OpenAI API key.

- **Purpose**: To provide a method for setting the OpenAI API key programmatically.

- **Parameters**:
  - `key`: The OpenAI API key to be set.

- **Behavior**:
  - Validates the provided API key to ensure it is not empty.
  - Sets the `openai.api_key` with the provided key.

- **Error Handling**: Raises a `ValueError` if the provided API key is invalid (empty).

## Usage

- **`get_openai_client`**: Used to get a singleton instance of the OpenAI client in a thread-safe manner. It is particularly useful in environments with multiple threads requiring access to the OpenAI API.
  
- **`set_openai_key`**: Allows setting the OpenAI API key dynamically in scenarios where the key might change or not be set via environment variables.

## Example

```python
# Set the OpenAI API key
set_openai_key('your-api-key')

# Get the OpenAI client instance
client = get_openai_client()
```

## Implementation Notes

- The use of threading and environment variables ensures that the OpenAI client is both thread-safe and flexible in terms of configuration.
- The `instructor.patch` function is used to modify the behavior of the OpenAI client, though the specifics of this patch are not detailed in the provided code.
