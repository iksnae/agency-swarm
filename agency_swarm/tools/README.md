# BaseTool

## Purpose

The `BaseTool` component is a foundational aspect of the Agency Swarm framework, serving as the superclass for all tools utilized by agents. It establishes the standard structure and behavior for tools, making it essential for defining functionalities that agents will leverage to interact with LLMs and facilitate various AI-driven tasks.

## Input and Output Specifications

As `BaseTool` is an abstract class, it typically doesn't have direct inputs or outputs. However, tools derived from it will supply their inputs (parameters for the tool's operation) and process them to generate outputs (the results of the tool's actions).

## Functionality

`BaseTool` outlines the necessary methods and properties that all child tools must implement. It provides the blueprint for creating tools with consistent behavior and interaction patterns, which is particularly important when these tools interface with different LLMs.

## Usage Examples

Defining a customized tool that inherits from `BaseTool`:

```python
from agency_swarm.tools import BaseTool

class CustomAnalysisTool(BaseTool):
    # Define input parameters and behaviors
    def run(self, data):
        # Analysis logic for the provided data
        analyzed_result = perform_analysis(data)
        return analyzed_result

# Usage
analysis_tool = CustomAnalysisTool()
result = analysis_tool.run(some_data)
```

## Best Practices

- Use `BaseTool` as the abstract foundation for all custom tools, ensuring consistency across the system.
- Design tools to be LLM-agnostic as much as possible, facilitating easier integration and swapability between different LLM providers.
- Regularly update and document the behavior of each tool to maintain transparency and ease of use.

## Conclusion

By deriving custom tools from the `BaseTool`, developers ensure a standard approach to tool creation within the Agency Swarm framework, promoting seamless integration and usage within AI-driven projects.
