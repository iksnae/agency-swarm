# Agent

## Purpose

The `Agent` class is a fundamental component of the Agency Swarm framework. It is used to define individual agents within the swarm, allowing you to assign specific roles, functionalities, and tools to each of them. An agent can represent a role such as a developer, virtual assistant, project manager, etc.

## Input and Output Specifications

- **name** (str): A unique identifier for the agent.
- **description** (str): A brief description of the agent's role and responsibilities.
- **instructions** (str): Guidance on how the agent is expected to function and interact within the swarm.
- **files_folder** (Optional[str]): The path to a folder containing files relevant to the agent.
- **tools** (List[BaseTool]): A list of tools that the agent can use to perform its tasks.

Output from an `Agent` is usually in the form of responses to prompts or actions taken using the tools assigned to it.

## Functionality

The `Agent` class encapsulates the functionality needed to interact with the AI behind the scenes and coordinate within the agency swarm. When an `Agent` is called upon, it processes instructions, utilizes tools, and manages interactions based on the roles defined for it.

## Usage Example

Creating a virtual assistant agent:

```python
from agency_swarm.agents import Agent
from some_tool_library import CustomTool

va_agent = Agent(
    name="VirtualAssistant",
    description="Responsible for handling customer inquiries and automating routine tasks.",
    instructions="Handle incoming customer queries and delegate tasks as necessary.",
    files_folder="./va_files",
    tools=[CustomTool]
)
```

## Best Practices

- Clearly define the roles and responsibilities for each agent to avoid overlap and ensure efficiency within the swarm.
- Use descriptive names and detailed instructions to make the agent's functionality transparent to other contributors.
- Regularly review and update the tools associated with each agent to match the evolving needs of the agency swarm.
- Consider the files_folder parameter to group related resources and maintain an organized structure.

## Extending the Agent Class

If you need to customize the `Agent` class further, you can subclass it and add additional methods or properties that cater to your specific requirements.

```python
# CustomAgent.py
from agency_swarm.agents import Agent

class CustomAgent(Agent):
    """ Custom implementation for a specialized agent role """
    # additional properties and methods here

# Usage
my_custom_agent = CustomAgent(
    name="SpecialAgent",
    # ... other parameters as needed
)
```

## Conclusion

Understanding and utilizing the `Agent` class effectively is key to harnessing the full potential of the Agency Swarm framework and creating a versatile and dynamic AI development environment.
